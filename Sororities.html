<p>Sorority life is filled with countless experiences that will last a lifetime. Becoming a part of a chapter can be very competitive but comes with a rewarding outcome. Each sisterhood was designed to provide forever friendship and sisters for life. This commitment involves dedication and loyalty. Sisters are committed to wearing their letters throughout their time at the university as well as in their walk of life; representing the sorority overall. Each sorority has a philanthropy that one fundraises for, community service is the top priority for most. Sisters over time develop all kinds of new skills, learning how to balance social activities and academics in the best way possible. Sororities provide personal growth as well as professional development and opportunities. Members attend numerous events, often open doors to meet sisters as well as building other connections within your chapter. The member count of each sorority can range from campus to campus, although there are many ways to get to know one another. Every chapter has a purpose.</p>
