<p1>Being a Redhawk does not end when you walk across the stage to receive your diploma. Miami University is known for its welcoming community, and friends that turn into forever family. Graduating is a big accomplishment to most, but some say becoming a Redhawk is too. Alumni often find themselves gravitating towards each other in the outside world, eventually making the small world connection. This university is known for its strong values and love for student education. We stand and say, “Love and Honor”.</p1>
