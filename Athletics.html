<h1>STUDENT ATHLETE LIFE</h1>
<p>The athletic department has various sports counselors/advisors that stay up to date with the athletes well being and walk to academic achievements. There are multiple leadership positions that create a welcoming environment for athletes to get the help they need while playing their sport. Whether an athlete's long-term goal is to go pro or not, advisors ensure that there is a plan to succeed on their path to their degree. Because playing a college sport can be overwhelming, advisors work with students to create a personalized plan to balance life overall as an athlete; personal life, academics, etc. Miami University prioritized athletes' mental health and psychological state. This creates a headspace where a student can perform their best. Having the support system of an athletic department can be detrimental to an athlete's journey.</p>
